Stakeholder Interviewed: Nicole Bao (Boss of the nearby restaurant Chef Tan)

Problem/frustrations:

1. Low work efficiency: During the peak time, and limit amount of waiter, customers might need to wait a long time for a person come to take their order.
2. High risk of ordering error: It's possible that waiter order the wrong dish for customers, which cause the waste of time, money, and unsatisfaction of customer. 
3. Higher operational costs: Need to hire more waiters during peak time in order to handle the amount of people
